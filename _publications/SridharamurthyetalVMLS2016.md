abstract: 'Voids and pockets in a protein, collectively called as cavities, refer to empty spaces that are enclosed by the protein molecule. Existing methods to compute, measure, and visualize the cavities in a protein molecule are sensitive to inaccuracies in the empirically determined atomic radii. This paper presents a topological framework that enables robust computation and visualization of these structures. Given a fixed set of atoms, cavities are represented as subsets of the weighted Delaunay triangulation of atom centres. A novel notion of (Œµ,ùúã)-stable cavities helps identify cavities that are stable even after perturbing the atom radii by a small value. An efficient method is described to compute these stable cavities for a given input pair of values (Œµ,ùúã). This approach is used to identify potential pockets and channels in protein structures.'
