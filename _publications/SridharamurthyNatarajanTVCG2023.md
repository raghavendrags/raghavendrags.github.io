abstract: 'Comparative analysis of scalar fields is an important problem with various applications including feature-directed visualization and feature tracking in time-varying data. Comparing topological structures that are abstract and succinct representations of the scalar fields lead to faster and meaningful comparison. While there are many distance or similarity measures to compare topological structures in a global context, there are no known measures for comparing topological structures locally. While the global measures have many applications, they do not directly lend themselves to fine-grained analysis across multiple scales. We define a local variant of the tree edit distance and apply it towards local comparative analysis of merge trees with support for finer analysis. We also present experimental results on time-varying scalar fields, 3D cryo-electron microscopy data, and other synthetic data sets to show the utility of this approach in applications like symmetry detection and feature tracking.'
